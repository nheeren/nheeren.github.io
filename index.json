This paper presents a study of emissions from Brazilian office buildings using building archetypes. A sensitivity analysis explores possible parameter ranges, various contributions to life-cycle impacts and their key drivers. For each of the 1000 building variations in the sample, the emissions were calculated using a life-cycle assessment. Multivariate regression analysis enabled the study of the results’ sensitivity to 10 parameters, influencing building operation, design and others. The emissions ranged from 20 to 106 kg CO2-eq/m2 gross floor area and year.

Next to energy efficiency and low-carbon energy supply, material efficiency is the third pillar of deep decarbonization for these sectors. For residential buildings, wood construction and reduced floorspace show the highest potential.

Scenario developments in industrial ecology have focused on disparate components of the socioeconomic metabolism and case studies, and few efforts of comprehensive and cumulative scenario formulation are documented. Many important, empirically derived relationships between material cycles, end‐use services, and energy use are relevant to global scenario modeling efforts, for example, of integrated assessment models (IAMs), which do not routinely describe material cycles or the life‐cycle impacts of various technology shifts. These inconsistent depictions of material cycles and their environmental impacts hinder the assessment of sustainable development strategies such as demand‐side sufficiency, material efficiency, and energy efficiency. We developed three highly detailed scenarios covering 20 global regions to 2060 for the service provisioning of dwelling area and personal transport grounded in salient building and vehicle operation parameters. Our scenarios are based on, and interface with, the Low Energy Demand (LED) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1 and SSP2) narratives. The results comprise scenario‐, region‐, and period‐specific narratives and corresponding parameter values, including per‐capita floor space and vehicle stocks, building and vehicle archetype mixes, passenger‐km, vehicle‐km, vehicle occupancy rates, and implementation potentials of nine material efficiency strategies. The explicit storyline extension approach presented here is an alternative to the aggregate GDP‐driven or historical trend extrapolations of service or energy demands. We describe the scenario formulation processes, resulting parameters, their applications, and offer an outlook for prospective sustainability models.","tags":["Industrial Ecology","Collaboration","Review","Resource Efficiency","Scenarios","RECC project"],"title":"A comprehensive set of global scenarios of housing, mobility, and material efficiency for material cycles and energy systems modelling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Niko Heeren","Edgar Hertwich"],"categories":[],"content":"Want to learn more about our work behind the report to the G7 and United Nations Environment Programme?

A change of the industrial landscape and a partial transformation of energy supply have contributed to reductions so far, but for deep reductions, a deep transformation of the country's industrial metabolism is needed.\nWhile energy efficiency is well established, the same cannot be said for material efficiency, which includes product light‐weighting, lifetime extension, more intense use, and value retention strategies like higher recycling rates, remanufacturing, and reuse. Sector‐specific research showed substantial energy and emissions savings potentials of material efficiency, but the overall material efficiency potential for most world economies, including Germany, is unknown.\nWe applied an open‐source and modular dynamic material flow analysis model of the transformation of passenger vehicles, residential buildings, and commercial and service buildings in Germany (together ca. 50% of national greenhouse gases) to a material‐efficient system, covering the time span 2016–2060. The potential impact of the above‐mentioned material efficiency strategies was studied for the climate‐relevant materials concrete, steel, timber, aluminum, and plastics.\nOnce the potentials of energy‐efficient products, electrification of end‐use sectors, and energy system transformation are seized, supply and demand side material efficiency and sufficiency can reduce remaining 2050 emissions by an additional 19–34 % (passenger vehicles), 27–31% (residential buildings), and 14–19% (non‐residential buildings). The 2016–2050 cumulative savings can be up to 750 Mt (million metric tons) CO2‐eq. Material efficiency can be a key contributor to deep emissions cuts like a 95% target.","tags":["RECC project","MFA","Resource Efficiency","Material","Open Science","Open Access"],"title":"Material efficiency and its contribution to climate change mitigation in Germany: A deep decarbonization scenario analysis until 2060","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Farzin Golzar","Niko Heeren","Stefanie Hellweg","Ramin Roshandel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604188800,"objectID":"7322a8199954a883c12f8229d3ef82d6","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/golzar-2020/","publishdate":"2020-11-13T12:13:57.674176Z","relpermalink":"/publication/golzar-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The aim of this paper is to develop a simulation framework to minimise the cost associated with commercial greenhouse yields (production cost). Greenhouse energy demand and yield production models are coupled with a cost model to investigate the interaction between energy consumption costs and yield production benefits. The coupled model is defined as an optimisation problem to determine the optimal values of decision variables (e.g. cover material, heating and cooling technology, inside temperature and relative humidity set points, plant density, etc.), which result in minimum production cost as the objective function. The results show that the integrated energy demand-crop yield production model outperforms the “classical approach” of a separate energy consumption model where yield is not explicitly modelled but only considered by constraints warranting good growing conditions. In the case of a tomato greenhouse in Iran, the financial cost and environmental impact of producing a 1 kg yield based on integrated energy demand-yield production model were 49% and 29% lower than the energy-consumption model alone. Moreover, the impact of fuel prices on the optimisation results is investigated by use of the proposed framework. Considering real fuel prices instead of current subsidised fuel prices in the Iranian case study, 70% of energy consumption and 19% of climate change impacts could be eliminated while increasing the production cost by 17%. Selling the saved fuel at real prices to other customers would provide the government with more than enough money to compensate the farmers for the increased yield cost.","tags":["LCA","Greenhouse","Food","Energy","Review","Simulation","Material-Energy Nexus","Optimisation"],"title":"Optimisation of energy-efficient greenhouses based on an integrated energy demand-yield production model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xining Yang","Mingming Hu","Niko Heeren","Chunbo Zhang","Teun Verhagen","Arnold Tukker","Bernhard Steubing"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1601964031,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603864831,"objectID":"43dde4cd53f4c67bbe45798593d7b0ce","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/yang-2020/","publishdate":"2020-10-06T08:00:31+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/yang-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"High spatial resolution is critical for a building stock energy model to identify spatial hotspots and provide targeted recommendations for reducing regional energy consumption. However, input uncertainties due to lacking high-resolution spatial data (e.g. building information and occupant behavior) can cause great discrepancies between modeled and actual energy consumption. We present a modeling framework that can act as a blueprint model for most European countries based on geo- referenced data, building archetypes, and public algorithms. Further sophistication is added in a step-wise approach, including the shift from average to hourly weather data, refurbishment, and occupants’ heating schedules. The model is demonstrated for the city of Leiden, the Netherlands, and the simulated results are spatially validated against the measured natural gas consumption reported at postcode level. Results show that when these factors are considered, the model can provide a good estimate of the energy consumption at the city scale (overestimated by 6%). At postcode level, nearly 83% of the absolute differences between modeled and measured natural gas consumption are within one standard deviation (±25 kWh/m2a, about 30% of the mean measured natural gas consumption). Further research and data would be required to provide reliable results at the level of individual buildings, e.g. information on refurbishment and occupant behavior. The model is well suited to identify spatial hotspots of residential energy consumption and could thus provide a practical basis (e.g. maps) for targeted measures to mitigate climate change.","tags":["Building stock","Energy","GIS","Simulation"],"title":"A combined GIS-archetype approach to model residential space heating energy: A case study for the Netherlands including validation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Wolfram","Qingshi Tu","Niko Heeren","Stefan Pauliuk","Edgar Hertwich"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1600322431,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603864831,"objectID":"fd73de542e9422ddaf4867e6fd8ae3c0","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/wolfram-2020/","publishdate":"2020-09-17T08:00:31+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/wolfram-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"A transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy is currently underway but may not be rapid enough in order to reach ambitious climate change mitigation targets. Therefore, additional, preferably instantaneous, measures are needed for quick emission reductions, which is where material efficiency (ME) could constitute a promising solution. ME strategies include but are not limited to vehicle lightweighting through material substitution, increased recycling of materials, reuse and remanufacturing of vehicle components, vehicle downsizing (switching to a smaller vehicle), and more intensive use by means of increased vehicle occupancy through sharing practices. While recent analyses have focused on a narrow subset of ME strategies, we find striking differences in the overall potential of different measures to decrease vehicular carbon footprints. Downsizing and more intensive use offer the largest mitigation potential but strongly depend on consumer behavior and are highly sensitive to modeling assumptions. Combined, the analyzed strategies can achieve emission reductions of up to 57% over the life cycle of a single vehicle, which is comparable to up to 83% achieved through a shift to low‐carbon energy supply. ME can cut carbon footprints of already efficient vehicles charging renewable electricity by half again. This makes ME both an excellent short‐term solution for climate change mitigation targeting the light‐vehicle sector but also an important complementary strategy to the long‐term transition toward electric vehicles and renewable energy supply.","tags":["Cars","Simulation","Resource Efficiency","RECC project","Open Science","Material-Energy Nexus"],"title":"Material efficiency and climate change mitigation of passenger vehicles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marian Chertow","Koichi Kanaoka","T.

More efficient use of materials—through decoupling of services that support human well‐being from material use—is imperative as other emission mitigation options are expensive. An interdisciplinary scientific assessment of material efficiency and its links to service provision, material cycle management, and climate policy is needed to identify effective strategies and help design the policy framework required for their implementation. We present the resource efficiency–climate change (RECC) mitigation framework, a first step toward such a comprehensive assessment. RECC is based on dynamic material flow analysis and links the services provided (individual motorized transport and shelter) to the operation of in‐use stocks of products (passenger vehicles and residential buildings), to their expansion and maintenance, and to their material cycles to model mitigation strategies and analyze trade‐offs for environmental impacts along the products’ life cycle. A key innovation of RECC is the upscaling of product archetypes with different degrees of material and energy efficiency, which are simulated with engineering tools. We utilize RECC with augmented storylines of the shared socioeconomic pathways to describe future service demand and associated material requirements. Ten material efficiency strategies at different stages of the material cycle can be assessed by ramping up their implementation rates to the identified technical potentials. RECC provides scenario results for the life cycle impacts of ambitious service–material decoupling concurrent with energy system decarbonization, giving detailed insights on the RECC mitigation nexus to policy‐makers worldwide.","tags":["RECC project","MFA","Material","Open Science","Open Access","Resource Efficiency"],"title":"Linking service provision to material cycles: A new framework for studying the resource efficiency–climate change (RECC) nexus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeffrey Rissman","Chris Bataille","Eric Masanet","Nate Aden","William R Morrow","Nan Zhou","Neal Elliott","Rebecca Dell","Niko Heeren","Brigitta Huckestein","Joe Cresko","Sabbie Miller","Joyashree Roy","Paul Fennell","Betty Cremmins","Thomas Koch Blank","David Hone","Ellen D.

It identifies measures that, employed together, can achieve net zero industrial emissions in the required timeframe. Key supply-side technologies include energy efficiency (especially at the system level), carbon capture, electrification, and zero-carbon hydrogen as a heat source and chemical feedstock. There are also promising technologies specific to each of the three top-emitting industries: cement, iron \u0026 steel, and chemicals \u0026 plastics. These include cement admixtures and alternative chemistries, several technological routes for zero-carbon steelmaking, and novel chemical catalysts and separation technologies. Crucial demand-side approaches include material-efficient design, reductions in material waste, substituting low-carbon for high-carbon materials, and circular economy interventions (such as improving product longevity, reusability, ease of refurbishment, and recyclability). Strategic, well-designed policy can accelerate innovation and provide incentives for technology deployment. High-value policies include carbon pricing with border adjustments or other price signals; robust government support for research, development, and deployment; and energy efficiency or emissions standards. These core policies should be supported by labeling and government procurement of low-carbon products, data collection and disclosure requirements, and recycling incentives. In implementing these policies, care must be taken to ensure a just transition for displaced workers and affected communities. Similarly, decarbonization must complement the human and economic development of low- and middle-income countries.","tags":["Open Access","Review","Resource Efficiency","Industry","Material"],"title":"Technologies and policies to decarbonize global industry: Review and assessment of mitigation drivers through 2070","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Pagani","Rafael Laurenti","Claudia R.

Materials are vital to modern society, but their production is an important source of greenhouse gases.

Demand-side material efficiency widens the spectrum of emissions mitigation strategies and may therefore reduce the need for other risky, contested, unproven or expensive technologies. Knowledge gaps regarding the link between material efficiency and climate change mitigation continue to exist, especially regarding the efficacy of policies where the focus of material efficiency has largely been confined to the end-of-life stage, such as targets for increased recycling. Socioeconomic transformations are crucial to harnessing the full potential of material efficiency, as, for example, greater intensity of use implies significant changes in use patterns or car ownership.","tags":["Resource Efficiency","RECC project","United Nations","Report","GHG","Prospective","Model","Carbon budget"],"title":"Bridging the gap: enhancing material efficiency in residential buildings and cars","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefan Pauliuk","Niko Heeren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"db0c3684086f249a8dc7dbba51f194e1","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/pauliuk-2019-odym/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.678339Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pauliuk-2019-odym/","section":"publication","summary":"Material flow analysis (MFA) studies the stocks and flows of goods and substances in systems. The methods and algorithms of MFA have improved over the last years, but a flexible platform that integrates recent modeling advances such as simultaneous consideration of the product, component, material, and chemical element levels, lifetime models, and uncertainty treatment is not available. There is also no versatile data format for exchanging data between projects. This lack of research infrastructure is detrimental to scientific progress. To fill that gap, we propose a novel industrial ecology community model for MFA. ODYM (Open Dynamic Material Systems Model) is an open source framework for material systems modelling programmed in Python. The description of systems, processes, stocks, flows, and parameters is object-based, which facilitates the development of modular software and testing routines for individual model blocks. ODYM MFA models can handle any depth of flow and stock specification: products, components, sub-components, materials, alloys, waste, and chemical elements can be traced simultaneously. ODYM features a new data structure for material flow analysis; all input and output data are stored in a standardized file format and can thus be exchanged across projects. It also comes with an extended library for dynamic stock modelling. We present the features, design principles, software and data structure of ODYM, describe its main methods and functions, and give an outlook on current and future applications.","tags":["RECC project","MFA","Material","Open Science","Open Access","Software","Code"],"title":"ODYM – An Open Software Framework for Studying Dynamic Material Systems.

Presently, the physico-chemical properties of high Portland cement (PC) materials are generally well known, as they also are for an increasing number of low(er) PC materials involving common supplementary cementitious materials like fly ash. However, low(er) PC materials with increasingly diverse chemistry and performance continue to be developed in an effort to reduce CO2 emissions, which is increasing the number of viable cement related materials (CRMs) available for use. In turn, a growing number of physico-chemical processes need to be better understood in order to analyse their performance, making applications of deterministic approaches more challenging. Similarly, it is becoming more challenging to assess their life cycle environmental impacts (hereafter ‘impacts’). Here, we describe a Monte Carlo based algorithm and use it to explore relationships among key chemical and physical properties (e.g., durability with respect to steel corrosion, and binder porosity), and also impacts of CRMs. The algorithm uses realistic assumptions about the behaviour of CRMs and couples thermodynamic modelling, understanding of corrosion chemistry, and a life cycle assessment model. We present results obtained by applying this algorithm to CRMs standardised in BS EN 197-1:2011. These results are discussed with a view to identify parameter spaces for each standardised material that approach optimal performance in terms of key chemical and physical properties, and impacts. Therefore, our results can be used to guide the development, optimisation, and use of higher performance and lower impact CRMs.","tags":["Material","LCA","Cement","Probabilistic"],"title":"Monte Carlo approach to integrated chemical, physical, and life cycle impact assessments of cement related materials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefan Pauliuk","Niko Heeren","Mohammad Mahadi Hasan","Daniel B.

This artificial division of data into methods contradicts the common phenomena described by those data: the objects and processes in the industrial system, or socioeconomic metabolism (SEM). A consequence of this scattered organization of related data across methods is that IE researchers and consultants spend too much time searching for and reformatting data from diverse and incoherent sources, time that could be invested into quality control and analysis of model results instead. This article outlines a solution to two major barriers to data exchange within IE: (a) the lack of a generic structure for IE data and (b) the lack of a bespoke platform to exchange IE datasets. We present a general data model for SEM that can be used to structure all data that can be located in the industrial system, including process descriptions, product descriptions, stocks, flows, and coefficients of all kind. We describe a relational database built on the general data model and a user interface to it, both of which are open source and can be implemented by individual researchers, groups, institutions, or the entire community. In the latter case, one could speak of an IE data commons (IEDC), and we unveil an IEDC prototype containing a diverse set of datasets from the literature.","tags":["Open Access","Open Science","Data","Data Science"],"title":"A general data model for socioeconomic metabolism and its implementation in an industrial ecology data commons prototype","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Janez Potočnik*","Julia Okatz","Niko Heeren","Edgar Hertwich"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"57800713e2259a7bd58ade0cd63b26ca","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/talk/g-7-2019/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.696864Z","relpermalink":"/talk/g-7-2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Upcoming IRP G7 report `GHG mitigation through material efficiency in residential buildings and light-duty vehicles'","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Edgar Hertwich","Saleem Ali","Luca Ciacci","Tomer Fishman","Niko Heeren","Eric Masanet","Farnaz Nojavan Asghari","Elsa Olivetti","Stefan Pauliuk","Qingshi Tu","Paul Wolfram"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555372800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555372800,"objectID":"5644f9913c2a22915f9a6060ec22cf7c","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/hertwich-recc-review/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.675583Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hertwich-recc-review/","section":"publication","summary":"As one quarter of global energy use serves the production of materials, the more efficient use of these materials presents a significant opportunity for the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With the renewed interest of policy makers in the circular economy, material efficiency (ME) strategies such as light-weighting and downsizing of and lifetime extension for products, reuse and recycling of materials, and appropriate material choice are being promoted. Yet, the emissions savings from ME remain poorly understood, owing in part to the multitude of material uses and diversity of circumstances and in part to a lack of analytical effort. We have reviewed emissions reductions from ME strategies applied to buildings, cars, and electronics. We find that there can be a systematic trade-off between material use in the production of buildings, vehicles, and appliances and energy use in their operation, requiring a careful life cycle assessment of ME strategies. We find that the largest potential emission reductions quantified in the literature result from more intensive use of and lifetime extension for buildings and the light-weighting and reduced size of vehicles. Replacing metals and concrete with timber in construction can result in significant GHG benefits, but trade-offs and limitations to the potential supply of timber need to be recognized. Repair and remanufacturing of products can also result in emission reductions, which have been quantified only on a case-by-case basis and are difficult to generalize. The recovery of steel, aluminum, and copper from building demolition waste and the end-of-life vehicles and appliances already results in the recycling of base metals, which achieves significant emission reductions. Higher collection rates, sorting efficiencies, and the alloy-specific sorting of metals to preserve the function of alloying elements while avoiding the contamination of base metals are important steps to further reduce emissions.","tags":["Resource Efficiency","Review","RECC project","Open Access"],"title":"Material efficiency strategies to reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with buildings, vehicles, and electronics – A review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Niko Heeren","Tomer Fishman"],"categories":null,"content":"Ever wondered how much material is in a building?

We couple a combined greenhouse energy demand-yield simulation tool with a life cycle assessment to identify the drivers for greenhouse energy, water and CO2 demand as well as yield production. Environmental impacts are evaluated using the methods of IPPC for assessing climate change and available water remaining (AWARE) for water scarcity impacts. Furthermore, we compare the results for all five main climate world regions. With a global sensitivity analysis, we identify the parameters with the highest influence on life-cycle impact for each region.\nCrop growth features (e.g. node development rate and plant density), energy systems (e.g. heating and cooling supply systems), cover materials and inside temperature are the most influential input parameters for climate change impacts, but the ranking between these parameters depends on the location and climatic conditions of the greenhouse. In cold climates and higher latitudes, heating and electricity (mostly for lighting) processes are on average responsible for 85 to 90% of total climate change impacts. In hot climates, active cooling, in addition to natural ventilation, as well as electricity processes rank the highest (in the range of 60 to 75%) and in moderate climates, heating and cooling systems account for 60 to 70% of climate change impacts. Also for the AWARE results, crop growth related parameters are most influential. Among different processes in greenhouse, irrigation is responsible for 90% of water impacts in all regions, but the absolute magnitude of impact varies greatly among the different greenhouse locations.","tags":["LCA","Greenhouse","Food","Energy","Review","Simulation","Material-Energy Nexus"],"title":"A comparative study on the environmental impact of greenhouses: a probabilistic

the next decades, a large share of residential buildings in EU-28 is expected to be renovated to achieve the 2 °C target requested by the Paris Agreement by 2050. Bio-based materials used for increasing the thermal insulation and temporary store carbon in construction elements might be a valuable opportunity that can contribute to accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon society. This article investigates the effect of massively storing carbon in bio-based construction products when used for the renovation of existing facades. Five alternative construction solutions were compared, three with a large amount of fast-growing biogenic material used as insulation, one with timber used for the frame and additional fibrewood as insulation, and the last one with synthetic insulation. A statistic-based Geocluster model was developed to predict the future material flow for building renovation in EU-28 and a dynamic life cycle assessment performed in order to verify the contribution of construction materials in reducing/increasing the carbon emissions over time. The results show that fast-growing biogenic materials have an increased potential to act as a carbon sink compared to timber. In particular, if straw is used as an insulation material, the capacity to store carbon from the atmosphere is effective in the short-term, which represents an important strategy towards the Paris climate Agreement goals.","tags":["Biomass","Building stock","Europe","Retrofit","Carbon strorage"],"title":"Retrofit as a carbon sink: The carbon storage potentials of the EU housing stock","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ester van der Voet","Benjamin Sprecher","Tomer Fishman","Weiqiang Chen","Hiroki Tanikawa","Niko Heeren","Jaco Huisman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b5be014aab5cd6252033c455f56ceddf","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/talk/voet-isie-2019-chair/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.723385Z","relpermalink":"/talk/voet-isie-2019-chair/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Special Session on Urban stocks and Urban mining","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Niko Heeren*","Tomer Fishman","Stefan Pauliuk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"aa07620d73a239577fb9e2d655bb7a98","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/talk/heeren-openscience-isie-2019/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.728996Z","relpermalink":"/talk/heeren-openscience-isie-2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The community-driven material intensity platform for IE open science","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Dimitra Ioannidou","Niko Heeren","Guido Sonnemann","Guillaume Habert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"3c09744091055fd289440fd36cd97464","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/ioannidou-jie/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.677011Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ioannidou-jie/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent literature, the concept of criticality aspires to provide a multifaceted risk assessment of resource supply shortage. However, most existing methodologies for the criticality assessment of raw materials are restricted to a fixed temporal and spatial reference system. They provide a snapshot in time of the equilibrium between supply and demand/economic importance and do not account for temporal changes of their indicators. The static character of criticality assessments limits the use of criticality methodologies to short‐term policy making of raw materials. In the current paper, we argue for an enhancement of the criticality framework to account for three key dynamic characteristics, namely changes of social, technical, and economic features; consideration of the spatial dimension in site‐specific assessments; and impact of changing governance frameworks. We illustrate how these issues were addressed in studies outside of the field of criticality and identify the dynamic parameters that influence resource supply and demand based on a review of studies that belong to the general field of resource supply and demand. The parameters are grouped in seven categories: extraction, social, economic, technical, policy, market dynamics, and environmental. We explore how these parameters were considered in the reviewed studies and propose ways and specific examples of addressing the dynamic effects in the criticality indicators. Furthermore, we discuss the current work on future scenarios to provide reference points for indicator benchmarks. The insights and guidelines derived from the review and our recommendations for future research set the foundations for an enhanced dynamic and site‐specific criticality assessment framework.","tags":["Material","Criticality"],"title":"The future in and of criticality assessments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Beijia Huang","Feng Zhao","Tomer Fishman","Wei-Qiang Chen","Niko Heeren","Edgar G Hertwich"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"67d3bcfedf4738c9ada877eccb1ad8dc","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/huang-2018/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.679667Z","relpermalink":"/publication/huang-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"A rapidly increasing use of building materials poses threats to resources and the environment. Using novel, localized life cycle inventories and building material intensity data, this study quantifies the resource use of building materials in mainland China and evaluates their embodied environmental impacts. Newly built floor area and related material consumption grew 11% per annum from 2000 to 2015, leveling off at the end of this period. Concrete, sand, gravel, brick, and cement were the main materials used. Spatially, construction activities expanded from east China into the central part of the country. Cement, steel, and concrete production are the key contributors to associated environmental impacts, e.g., cement and steel each account for around 25% of the global warming potential from building materials. Building materials contribute considerably to the impact categories of human toxicity, fossil depletion, and global warming, emphasizing that greenhouse gas emissions should not be the sole focus of research on environmental impacts of building materials. These findings quantitatively shed light on the urgent need to reduce environmental impacts and to conserve energy in the manufacturing processes of building materials on the national scale.","tags":["LCA","Building stock","Material","MFA","China"],"title":"Building material use and associated environmental impacts in China 2000-2015","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Niko Heeren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"751ce3d1021dbe90e8dba9252a456aad","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/talk/heeren-agci/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.708461Z","relpermalink":"/talk/heeren-agci/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Resource Efficiency and Climate Change","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Niko Heeren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"ca758dcb19e7f8b8911a6dddea0d3c4e","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/talk/heeren-herus/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.70747Z","relpermalink":"/talk/heeren-herus/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Quantifying Environmental Impacts of Socio-Economic Systems","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Konstantin Stadler*","Stefan Pauliuk","Rupert J.

In order to investigate impacts of materials on a building level, we present a bottom‐up building stock model that uses three‐dimensional and geo‐referenced building data to determine volumetric information of material stocks in Swiss residential buildings. We used a probabilistic modeling approach to calculate future material flows for the individual buildings. We investigated six scenarios with different assumptions concerning per‐capita floor area, building stock turnover, and construction material. The Swiss building stock will undergo important structural changes by 2035. While this will lead to a reduced number in new constructions, material flows will increase. Total material inflow decreases by almost half while outflows double. In 2055, the total amount of material in‐ and outflows are almost equal, which represents an important opportunity to close construction material cycles. Total environmental impacts due to production and disposal of construction material remain relatively stable over time. The cumulated impact is slightly reduced for the wood‐based scenario. The scenario with more insulation material leads to slightly higher material‐related emissions. An increase in per‐capita floor area or material turnover will lead to a considerable increase in impacts. The new modeling approach overcomes the limitations of previous bottom‐up building models and allows for investigating building material flows and stocks in space and time. This supports the development of tailored strategies to reduce the material footprint and environmental impacts of buildings and settlements.","tags":["Material","MFA","Building stock","Dynamics","LCA","Material-Energy Nexus","Big data","GIS","NRP66 project","Simulation","Wood","Probabilistic","Switzerland","Open Access"],"title":"Tracking Construction Material over Space and Time: Prospective and Geo-referenced Modeling of Building Stocks and Construction Material Flows","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Niko Heeren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517443200,"objectID":"58be57921b795fc676ef9285f4d5a709","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/talk/heeren-epa/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.703095Z","relpermalink":"/talk/heeren-epa/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tracking construction material over space \u0026 time","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Farzin Golzar","Niko Heeren","Stefanie Hellweg","Ramin Roshandel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"26cd50ecd874d039d98f44dfd76af1c2","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/golzar-2018/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.77227Z","relpermalink":"/publication/golzar-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Greenhouses are complex systems that require considerable amounts of energy. In order to optimize their performance, it is necessary to reduce the amount of energy per unit of crop produced. This requires a combined assessment of greenhouse energy balance and crop growth, as well as their interaction. In this work, more than 30 existing greenhouse models are reviewed and different algorithms are combined to propose an integrated energy-yield model. The physical model of greenhouse energy demand is based on the dynamic energy and mass balance while yield production is based on a physiological crop model.\nThe integrated model is validated with observed energy demand and crop yield datasets during one full tomato growing period. There was good agreement between modeled results and measured data. The key advantage of the integrated model is that it can analyze drivers for greenhouse energy losses and quantify the influence of measures on both energy demand and crop yield. Due to the model's dynamic and high temporal resolution, it is possible to study the use of renewable energy sources in greenhouse operation, as illustrated for thermal storage by means of phase change materials. A sensitivity analysis by changing day/night temperature, CO2 indoor concentration and artificial lighting is performed. The results illustrate how the model can be used for optimizing the performance of greenhouses in terms of specific energy demand (energy per crop produced). Therefore, the integrated model can be a tool for determining the optimum design and control parameters, which is particularly relevant for growers and sustainable agriculture systems in general. This study presents a parametric decision support tool that assists planers with optimizing energy performance of greenhouses while analyzing the trade-off between energy demand and crop yield.","tags":["Energy","Greenhouse","Simulation","Food"],"title":"A novel integrated framework to evaluate greenhouse energy demand and crop yield production","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Froemelt*","René Buffat","Niko Heeren","Stefanie Hellweg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"d245d1a0ad1ee3f86f2f754871f28f39","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/froemelt-2018-setac/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.712767Z","relpermalink":"/publication/froemelt-2018-setac/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Assessing environmental impacts of individual households: A large-scale bottom-up LCA-model for Switzerland","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Froemelt*","René Buffat","Niko Heeren","Stefanie Hellweg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"1d26491149f72d9194363c369ee62254","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/talk/froemelt-2018-setac/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.712767Z","relpermalink":"/talk/froemelt-2018-setac/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Assessing environmental impacts of individual households: A large-scale bottom-up LCA-model for Switzerland","type":"talk"},{"authors":["York Ostermeyer","Claudio Nägeli","Niko Heeren","Holger Wallbaum"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"34f2e46afabc1c6602e6a06b2bd2e1e0","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/ostermeyer-2016/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.770277Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ostermeyer-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["NRP66 project","Building stock","Material","Open Access","Data"],"title":"Building Inventory and Refurbishment Scenario Database Development for Switzerland","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefan Pauliuk","Mahadi Hasan","Niko Heeren","Daniel Müller"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"2f4f022061e84707fd662c64354d9d8d","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/talk/pauliuk-iedc-code/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.718587Z","relpermalink":"/talk/pauliuk-iedc-code/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Industrial Ecology Data Commons (IEDC) Database","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Torhildur Fjola Kristjansdottir","Aoife Houlihan-Wiberg","Inger Andresen","Laurent Georges","Niko Heeren","Clara Stina Good","Helge Brattebø"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"797a9f5ef03490632780014559594d4a","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/kristjansdottir-2018/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.714692Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kristjansdottir-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["ZEB","LCA","Material-Energy Nexus"],"title":"Is a net life cycle balance for energy and materials achievable for a zero emission single-family building in Norway?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Edgar Hertwich","Niko Heeren","Brandon Kuczenski","Guillaume Majeau-Bettez","Rupert J.

This implies the need for greater transparency, accessibility, and reusability of IE data, paralleling the considerable momentum throughout the sciences. The Data Transparency Task Force (DTTF) was convened by the governing council of the International Society for Industrial Ecology in late 2016 to propose best‐practice guidelines and incentives for sharing data. In this article, the members of the DTTF present an overview of developments toward transparent and accessible data within the IE community and more broadly. We argue that increased transparency, accessibility, and reusability of IE data will enhance IE research by enabling more detailed and reproducible research, and also facilitate meta‐analyses. These benefits will make the results of IE work more timely. They will enable independent verification of results, thus increasing their credibility and quality. They will also make the uptake of IE research results easier within IE and in other fields as well as by decision makers and sustainability practitioners, thus increasing the overall relevance and impact of the field. Here, we present two initial actions intended to advance these goals: (1) a minimum publication requirement for IE research to be adopted by the Journal of Industrial Ecology; and (2) a system of optional data openness badges rewarding journal articles that contain transparent and accessible data.

Therefore, the building stock is an important stakeholder for reaching environmental targets. In Switzerland the vision of the 2000-Watt Society has been adopted by several cantons. It states that by 2050 the annual per capita consumption of primary energy must not exceed 17.5 MWh and greenhouse gas emissions remain below 1.0 ton of CO2-equivalents. This corresponds to a significant reduction, compared to today’s values. Based on the current literature on the assessment of buildings and building stocks, three main research gaps are identified. The first concerns the relevance of the different aspects causing environmental impacts in the construction sector. In particular material-related impacts have been rarely included into sensitivity analysis of whole buildings and the role of thermal mass is unclear. Secondly, new methods for building stock models are required. The most commonly used type are archetype bottom-up models, which have limitations concerning granularity, stock dynamics, quantification of uncertainty, and building representation. The third question deals with the implications of future material and energy flows of building stocks. Is it realistic to reach the targets of a 2000-Watt society? The central objective of this thesis is to close these research gaps and enhance the understanding and assessment of the building-environment system by exploring the complex relations between energy, material, environment, and building stock dynamics. To reach this objective, this thesis (i) investigates parameter sensitivity and identifies the most relevant drivers of impact, (ii) assesses the importance of construction material with regard to environmental life-cycle impact and accounting for dynamic thermal behaviour of buildings, (iii) quantifies different indicators of environmental impact, (iv) proposes a modelling approach for spatio-temporal assessment of building stocks, (v) defines and assesses prospective scenarios, and (vi) compares the results with environmental targets. Each chapter of this thesis presents a building model with specific features. The first model connects two specialised assessment tools with one another to capture the complexity of the building-environment system. On the one hand, a state-of-the-art dynamic thermal simulation tool, capable of accounting for thermal inertia, determines building energy demand. On the other hand, the resulting life cycle material and energy inventories are assessed with a life cycle assessment (LCA) tool. Furthermore, Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis is used to determine the influence of twenty-eight stochastic input parameters, describing aspects of building design, material, operation, and exogenic factors. The second model investigates the future energy demand of the Swiss building stock. It quantifies the related environmental impacts and investigates scenarios of future development. The results are then compared with the targets of the 2000-Watt society. The third model calculates space heat demand and the related environmental impacts of each building in a Swiss municipality. It investigates the characteristics of highand low-emission households by means of cluster analysis. The fourth model quantifies material stocks and flows for the entire Swiss residential building stock from today until 2055 and quantifies the related environmental impacts. The national model finds that the projected decline in population growth will lead to important changes in the building stock. On the one hand, this development helps to halt the increase in building energy demand and stabilize the related greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, the overlying dynamic of the building stock leads to the situation in which input material flows will decrease, but material waste flows increase. That means the building stock transitions from a growth state into a maintenance state. Unlike the energy-related emission, this does, however, not lead to a reduction of environmental impacts. Although the impacts due to concrete for new constructions reduce significantly, new impacts occur. The reason is the building stock renewal and the associated increase in impacts due to insulation and mineral material. As the quantity of input and output material flow are practically identical in the future, an important opportunity for circular material flows arises. However, new recycling technologies are required. Overall the importance of construction materials for the environmental performance of buildings will increase in the next decades. The targets of the 2000-Watt society can only be met by means of more ambitious strategies than the ones that are implemented today. Especially, an increased rate of refurbishment and demolition is required. This, however, leads also to a considerable increase of material-related impacts, unless energy-intensive materials (e.g. concrete) are substituted with low-impact materials, such as wood. The methods for building stock modelling are improved in different ways. Firstly, a new approach for tracking the evolution of the building’s thermal envelope is introduced. That allows to determine building space heat demand based on physical properties and thermal building simulation. Secondly, the change of electricity and thermal energy sources in buildings is considered by means of diffusion models. Using an approach that is based on life cycle assessment, it is possible to quantify also “hidden” environmental impacts, due to infrastructure, transport, etc., and greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide. Thirdly, this thesis demonstrates the feasibility of modelling the material stock and flows of the entire Swiss residential building stock. This was possible by merging three-dimensional building data and by using a geospatial relational database. Stochastic modelling was successfully applied to perform sensitivity analysis, close data gaps, and define future scenarios. The combined building assessment method, using thermal simulation and life cycle assessment, allows to account for the interaction of material and energy related parameters. The building stock models, presented in this thesis, show a number of innovations that will facilitate future work. For instance, they illustrate how GIS bottom-up models can be implemented for large building stocks and prospective scenario assessment. The modelling approaches, presented in this thesis, are relevant for future scientific work. In a next step the spatial-dynamic material flow analysis and the energy demand model should be coupled in order to investigate the trade-off between material and energy demand for the entire building stock. This is important for identifying possible rebounds of building stock renewal strategies. This thesis contains a number of results that are relevant for decision-makers in the building sector. These include specific building design recommendations as well as the identification of risks that hinder the achievement of environmental targets. Energy supply, space heat demand, and construction material are identified as the prime drivers of environmental impacts. The reduced thermal inertia of wooden buildings leads to increased space heat demand, but the negative influence on environmental impact is overcompensated by the lower embodied impacts of the construction material. Another driver of environmental impacts in building stocks is the per capita floor area demand, because it directly scales with energy and material demand. The results can be translated into a number of recommendations. The first priority for planners should be to use clean energy sources for a building. Energy demand is second most influential and mostly determined by ventilation rate. Therefore, buildings should have good air-tightness and a sound ventilation strategy (e.g. using CO2-sensors and heat recovery in the case of mechanical ventilation). Construction material ranks higher than many of the energy-related parameters. Wooden construction is practically always beneficial and should be prioritized. Service life is also very relevant and durability of materials should be ensured. Particularly buildings with a short lifetime should be built from low-impact materials, such as wood, since the initial impact of a concrete construction is relatively high. Buildings with high anticipated cooling loads (e.g. sun-exposed office buildings) may profit from a higher thermal mass. Concerning policy implications, the LCA-based assessment of construction material should be included into future construction regulations, similar as it is the case for space heat demand today. The models, presented in this thesis, can be used to develop national and also regionalised resource and refurbishment strategies. Finally, a significant risk for a ‘lock-in’ situation exists. Due to the very slow turnover of the building stock, it is imperative to implement forward-looking policies. In other words, the buildings for the 2000-Watt society need to be built today.","tags":["PhD","NRP66 project","Wood","Building stock","Material-Energy Nexus","Open Access"],"title":"Modelling

goal of this study was to identify drivers of environmental impact and quantify their influence on the environmental performance of wooden and massive residential and office buildings. We performed a life cycle assessment and used thermal simulation to quantify operational energy demand and to account for differences in thermal inertia of building mass. Twenty-eight input parameters, affecting operation, design, material, and exogenic building properties were sampled in a Monte Carlo analysis. To determine sensitivity, we calculated the correlation between each parameter and the resulting life cycle inventory and impact assessment scores. Parameters affecting operational energy demand and energy conversion are the most influential for the building?s total environmental performance. For climate change, electricity mix, ventilation rate, heating system, and construction material rank the highest. Thermal inertia results in an average 2-6% difference in heat demand. Non-renewable cumulative energy demand of wooden buildings is 18% lower, compared to a massive variant. Total cumulative energy demand is comparable. The median climate change impact is 25% lower, including end-of-life material credits and 22% lower, when credits are excluded. The findings are valid for small offices and residential buildings in Switzerland and regions with similar building culture, construction material production, and climate.","tags":["Simulation","Probabilistic","Material-Energy Nexus","NRP66 project","Wood","Simulation","Open Access"],"title":"Environmental Impact of Buildings---What Matters?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Niko Heeren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"5c1154e95c729cf94d6a6d7537b87b3e","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/talk/heeren-df-60-chair/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.749517Z","relpermalink":"/talk/heeren-df-60-chair/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"LCA of innovative wood products and wood energy systems","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Niko Heeren*","Stefanie Hellweg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"11eefdb0e17e45acfb97afbeab704717","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/talk/heeren-df-60/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.748587Z","relpermalink":"/talk/heeren-df-60/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The role of wood for the Swiss building stock","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Alexander Wunderlich","Niko Heeren","Holger Wallbaum"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"16b73588d14963c4d050079f66c45d63","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/wunderlich-2014/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.768386Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wunderlich-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Building stock","Prospective","Energy","Europe","BEEM-UP project"],"title":"Building Energy Efficiency for Massive market Uptake BEEM-UP Energetic Refurbishment Replication Strategy for Eastern European Countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Flóra Szkordilisz*","Niko Heeren","Guillaume Habert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"1d5f7903925fd26dce37ed9c9bbba3e9","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/szkordilisz-2014/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.767696Z","relpermalink":"/publication/szkordilisz-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Most LCA studies lately have been dealing with the dilemmas which material is more energy-efficient to use: wood or steel, concrete or wood?

We use Life Cycle Assessment and thermal numerical simulations to compare five houses, built either exclusively with one material or having both materials, either one at the ground floor and one in the first floor or one in all southern façades and the other in the northern walls.

However, it also has reduced capacity to store thermal energy, potentially causing increased operating energy demand. Here we investigate this trade-off between environmental impacts of the construction and operating phase and examine key factors determining the overall environmental performance. To do so we couple a sophisticated building simulation with a life cycle assessment tool. We investigate a massive and a wooden variant of a single-family home. Sensitivity is analysed by altering ten different input parameters, using upper and lower extreme values. We find that the influence of building thermal inertia on annual energy demand is relatively small, but may become significant when the building service life is taken into account. In general, impacts from building operation outweigh material-related ones. Accordingly, parameters affecting energy demand (e.g. ventilation rate) are most influential. Since massive and concrete buildings react differently to changes in different parameters, we recommend individual design strategies for each building variant.","tags":["Energy","Material","Simulation","LCA","Material-Energy Nexus","NRP66 project"],"title":"Influence of construction material choice and design parameters on greenhouse gas emissions of buildings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Jakob","Karin Flury","Nadja Gross","Gregor Martius","Benjamin Sunjaro","Beate Grodofzig Fürst","Marc Fürst","Niko Heeren","Holger Wallbaum"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"4670a27eba54fb2442f41afba4011e1a","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/jakob-2014-b/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.771313Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jakob-2014-b/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Building stock","German","Prospective","Energy","GIS"],"title":"Konzept Energieversorgung 2050","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominik Saner*","Carl Vadenbo","Bernhard Steubing","Niko Heeren","Andreas Froemelt","Stefanie Hellweg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"e08433503340b1365c33c2a9a04309d0","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/talk/saner-lca-2014/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.741088Z","relpermalink":"/talk/saner-lca-2014/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Modeling housing energy demand and optimizing energy supply","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Bernhard Steubing","Florian Suter","Niko Heeren","York Ostermeyer","A.

Attached to each household purchase are economic activities along the preceding supply chain, with the associated resource use and emissions. A method to capture and assess all these resource uses and emissions is life cycle assessment. We developed a model for the life cycle assessment of housing and land-based mobility (excluding air travel) consumption of individual households a small village in Switzerland. Statistical census and dwelling register data are the foundations of the model. In a case study performed on a midsized community, we found a median value of greenhouse gas emissions of 3.12 t CO2 equiv and a mean value of 4.30 t CO2 equiv per capita and year for housing and mobility. Twenty-one percent of the households in the investigated region were responsible for 50% of the total greenhouse gas emissions, meaning that if their emissions could be halved the total emissions of the community would be reduced by 25%. Furthermore, a cluster analysis revealed that driving factors for large environmental footprints are demands of large living area heated by fossil energy carriers, as well as large demands of motorized private transportation.","tags":["Probabilistic","Household","Transport","Building stock","LCA","GIS"],"title":"Housing and mobility demands of individual households and their life cycle assessment.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Niko Heeren","Martin Jakob","Gregor Martius","Nadja Gross","Holger Wallbaum"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1364774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1364774400,"objectID":"857641d312e9c244fce4c463d0533714","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/heeren-2013-a/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T19:26:01.025425Z","relpermalink":"/publication/heeren-2013-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Prospective","Energy","Building stock","LCA"],"title":"A component based bottom-up building stock model for comprehensive environmental impact assessment and target control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernhard Steubing*","Niko Heeren*"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"b1a157d0cabf8f03f51273c471888fb0","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/steubing-2013/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.76597Z","relpermalink":"/publication/steubing-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Wood resources are scarce and can at the same time be used for many applications ranging from construction, components, pulp and paper, and chemicals to energy.

In this paper, three major themes of a sustainable urban future are presented: a low carbon society, cities in the context of an ageing population and revitalization of the urban–rural fringe. Visions of these themes, in the context of highly industrialized regions, are discussed. To achieve a low carbon society, the importance of technological innovations such as new technologies and systems applied in buildings (homes and businesses), industries, and transportation are emphasized. To adapt to an ageing society, a compact city is seen with responsive transport, infrastructure and services that cater to the needs of the elderly. To enhance the urban–rural fringe, the introduction of eco-industries, which can create opportunities for both sides, is proposed.","tags":["Review"],"title":"Innovation for sustainability: toward a sustainable urban future in industrialized cities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Niko Heeren","Holger Wallbaum","Martin Jakob"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"f939953534bb948747ca0370895f8a01","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/heeren-2012/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T19:22:02.409793Z","relpermalink":"/publication/heeren-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Prospective","Energy","Building stock","LCA"],"title":"Towards a 2000 Watt society – assessing building-specific saving potentials of the Swiss residential building stock","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Niko Heeren"],"categories":null,"content":"MSc thesis\n","date":1314835200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1314835200,"objectID":"6de790e02c8f8a3da8bbb55790513d03","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/heeren-2011/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.758016Z","relpermalink":"/publication/heeren-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"MSc thesis","tags":["Prospective","Energy","Building stock","Simulation"],"title":"Ecological potentials of load management in buildings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Jakob","Karin Flury","Nadja Gross","Niko Heeren","Holger Wallbaum"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"66a83e5d8850f2fca06da4e141e19943","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/jakob-2011/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.757103Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jakob-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Building stock","German","Prospective","Energy"],"title":"2000-Watt-Gesellschafts-taugliches Energiekonzept für die Stadt Zürich","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Niko Heeren*","Holger Wallbaum","Martin Jakob"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"d6930646a9df4ffc5737761488fe9f52","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/heeren-2011-a/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.756148Z","relpermalink":"/publication/heeren-2011-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Prospective","Energy","Building stock","LCA"],"title":"Towards a 2000 Watt society – assessing building - specific saving potentials of the Swiss residential building stock","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Niko Heeren","Martin Jakob","Holger Wallbaum"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"e4c2f82ea731c779e8959218ff655d3c","permalink":"https://nheeren.github.io/publication/heeren-2010-a/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T12:13:57.673473Z","relpermalink":"/publication/heeren-2010-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Die Herausforderungen, denen sich der Gebäudepark Schweiz in den kommenden Jahren stellen muss, sind bedeutsam und vielseitig.
